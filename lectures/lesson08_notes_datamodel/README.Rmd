`dplyr` makes easy to translate R code into SQL code for querying databases. To see how that works, first we connect to our online reviews MySQL DB:

```{r}
#' this WON'T work off-campus unless you use a client server
#' you need to add USN/PW to con.R
#' DON'T push con.R to GitHub -- use .gitinore
source(here::here('lectures/lesson08_notes_datamodel/conn.R'))
dbListTables(con) # these are the entities in the DB
dbListFields(con, 'review') # these are the attributes in the entity review
```

Each dplyr query, is trasnlated to a SQL query. For instance, to query a whole entity:

```{r}
myTable <- tbl(con, 'review')
show_query(tbl(con, 'review')) #this shows how tbl(con, 'review') translates to SQL
tbl(con, sql('SELECT * FROM review')) #this is how you can use actual SQL
```

Note that even if you assign `tbl(con, 'review')` to an object, each time you call the object dplyr queries the DB again (you are not saving the table on your local machine). Also, note that you cannot use R function that are unavailable on your database. For instance:

```{r}
tbl(con, 'review') %>% mutate(mean(reviewService, na.rm = T))
```

A viable solution is to `collect()` the output of your query before:

```{r}
tbl(con, 'review') %>% collect() %>%  summarise(avg = mean(reviewService, na.rm = T))
```

However, you want to `collect()` as late as possible to make sure you leverage the computational power of your server and you avoid downloading unnecessary data on your machine.



#. Report the distinct types of hotels
```{r}
options(warn = -1)
tbl(con, 'hotel') %>%
  distinct(hotelType) %>%
  collect()
```


#. Report the top 3 hotels with the highest number of rooms (keep only hotelId, hotelName, hotelRooms)
```{r}
tbl(con, 'hotel') %>%
  select(hotelId, hotelName, hotelRooms) %>%
  arrange(desc(hotelRooms)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  slice(1:3)

tbl(con, sql('SELECT hotelId, hotelName, hotelRooms from hotel order by hotelRooms desc limit 3'))
```


#. Count the independent business (those who do not belong to any brand)
```{r}
tbl(con, 'hotel') %>%
  select(hotelId, hotelName, brandId) %>%
  filter(is.na(brandId)) %>%
  summarise(tot = n())
```


#. Report the top 3 hotels with the best service (calculate the average using review.reviewService)
```{r}
tbl(con, 'hotel') %>%
  inner_join(tbl(con, 'review')) %>%
  group_by(hotelName) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(reviewService)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  slice(1:3)
```


#. Report all the authors and the hotels they reviewed. Report the author name, the hotel ID and hotel name. Order the output by author name

```{r}
tbl(con, 'hotel') %>%
  inner_join(tbl(con, 'review')) %>%
  inner_join(tbl(con, 'author')) %>%
  select(authorNickname, hotelName, hotelId) %>%
  arrange(desc(authorNickname))
```


#. Report the total number of reviews received by each hotel. Report a three columns table with `hotelId`, `hotelName` and total number of reviews. Make sure that you are including hotels with zero reviews as well. Note that some hotels have 0 reviews. If you decide to count the rows in each grouping level, make sure you you don't count as 1 those who have zero reviews.

```{r}
tbl(con, 'hotel') %>%
  left_join(tbl(con, 'review')) %>%
  select(hotelId, hotelName, reviewId) %>%
  count(hotelId, hotelName, wt = !is.na(reviewId), sort = T)
```

#. Report how many chains established their headquarter in each country. Plot a barchart those frequencies by country and then add a title to your plot. Adjust your axes' labels as needed (remember that non-data ink points are modified within `theme()`).

```{r}
tbl(con, 'lodgingchain') %>%
  count(headquarters) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = headquarters, y = n)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
  ggtitle("Number of Hotels Per Country")
```


#. For each review of stays during 2011, calculate the composite average score as the mean of Location, Room, Service, Value and Cleanliness. Then plot a histogram (using `geom_hist()`) of the differences between the average of those 5 attributes and ratingOverall.

```{r}
tbl(con, 'review') %>%
  filter(reviewStayYear == '2011') %>%
  collect() %>%
  gather('attribute', 'score', reviewCleanliness:reviewValue) %>%
  group_by(reviewId) %>%
  summarise(avg = mean(score), overall = mean(reviewOverall)) %>%
  mutate(diff = avg - overall) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = diff))
```

*warning*: If you query the DB and then pipe the remote table into a ggplot2 function, you might need to `collect()` the remote table before passing it to `ggplot()`, because `ggplot()` expects a class `data.frame` (and tibbles are also data.frame). However, if you pass a different object (such as a connection) "it will be converted to one by fortify()" (see the documentation `?ggplot()`). 
Apparently, for some of you `fortify()` does not convert the table to a local data.frame, and if that is the case you need to `collect()`.


#. Report all data about brands that have minimum square footage requirement for rooms that exceeds the average minimum square footage of all brands by at least 50%.

```{r}
tbl(con, 'brand') %>%
  filter(!is.na(brandMinSqFt)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  filter(brandMinSqFt >= mean(brandMinSqFt)*1.5)
```
